				<h4> Ari is a robot designed to educate your child with the basics such as ABC's and their 123's. 
				This educational robot is different from other robots on the market because Ari makes sure that your child is following along.
				Ari's targeted audience is for toddlers but can also benefit children with learning disabilities such as ADHD. 
				This robot only continues with the activity if your child is responsing and if Ari does not hear a response for an amount of time,
				she will play a tune to get the child's attention and ask if the child wants to continue the activity or move on to another one.
